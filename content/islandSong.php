<h2>Island Song - Ashley Erikkson</h2>

    <br>
    Come along with me
    <br>
    And the butterflies and bees
    <br>
    We can wander through the forest
    <br>
    And do so as we please
    <br>
    <br>
    Come along with me
    <br>
    To a cliff under a tree
    <br>
    Where we can gaze upon the water
    <br>
    As an everlasting dream.
    <br>

    <br>
    All of my collections
    <br>
    I'll share them all with you
    <br>
    Maybe by next summer
    <br>
    We won't have changed our tune.
    <br>

    <br>
    We'll still want to be
    <br>
    With the butterflies and bees
    <br>
    Making up new numbers
    <br>
    And living so merrily.
    <br>

    <br>
    I'll be here for you
    <br>
    always And always be with you.
